# Usage
This application uses a debugging to to display information about its inner workings.

To run the application in debug mode you will need to run:
```
DEBUG=true npm start
```

## Debugging
To use this debug tool in the application you must put this line at the top of the file if it is not already there.
```
const utility = require(/Path to utility file);
```
After the tool has been included you can then console log any information using this line of code.
```
utility.debug('Message to be displayed.', Status Code);
```

## Sample
```
utility.debug('App route has been hit.', 200);
```
### Response
```
App route has been hit. 200
===========================
```


## Airbnb Style Guide
This application implements eslint to help correctly style and format its code.

### Installation
To install eslint you will need to run this command:
```
npm i --save-dev eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react
```
This command will install the eslint package and save it as a dev dependency.

You will also need to install a linter or eslinter packge for whatever IDE you are using. In this case I am using atom so I would navigate to the settings an search for the atom linter or linter-eslint package and install it.

### Configuration
You will need to add a .eslintrc.json file on the root level of the project and specify these rules inside:
```
{
	"env": {
		"node": true
	},
	"extends": "airbnb",
	"plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
	"rules": {
		"new-cap": 0,
		"prefer-template": 0,
		"global-require": 0
	},
	"globals": {
		"describe": true,
		"it": true
	}
}
```
This will tell eslint what to warn you about throughout the code.

# Unit testing
To run the unit tests inside of the test folder run the command:
```
mocha
```
This command looks through all files in the test folder and runs each specific test laid out inside.

To run the unit tests inside of the test folder in debug mode run the command:
```
DEBUG=true mocha
```
This command does everything that the first command does but also logs out information about each test.

## Istanbul
This application makes use of istanbul to generate code coverage reports displaying how much of your application is covered by unit tests.

To run istanbul use the command:
```
istanbul cover _mocha
```
